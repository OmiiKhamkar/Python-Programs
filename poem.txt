Sure! Here’s a short, original poem for you:

**✨ *Wings of Tomorrow* ✨**

In the quiet hours of fading light,
Dreams awake and take their flight.
Through silver clouds they softly glide,
With hope and courage as their guide.

Every step, a story grows—
Every heart, a river flows.
Hold your fire, keep your glow—
You’re stronger than you’ll ever know.
